# LeetCode Permutaions

Two methods learned:

Using hashSet mainiting visited index
Using swapping technique

# LeetCode Subsets

Two ways learned:
Using for Loop in recursive function. 
Without using for loop, take or not take approach.

# LeetCode Subsets 2

Important concept:
if (i > index && num[i] == num[i - 1]) continue;
This means the first index to every call will stored after this index duplicity will be checked!

# LeetCode Sudoku

Similar to N-Queens, Points:
Check for 3 condition using a single 0-9 loop,

a. Exist in row of not
b. Exist in col or not
