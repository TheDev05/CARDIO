# Maximum width of Binary Tree

           1     or    2     or       node
          / \         / \            /    \
         2   3       4   5      node*2   (node*2)+1

(3-2)+1 == 2 also (5-4)+1 == 2 ; no matter what the values of the child nodes their diffrence will always be same, but assure they are double & double + 1 of parent node respectively.

We indexed all nodes using ```std::map``` and also use minimum values to avoid overflow, subtract some common values(say minimum of that level) and then double it or use these values and in this way we avoid overflow.
